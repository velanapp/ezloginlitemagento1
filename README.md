Installing EzLogin on your Magento Store will allow your users to login using any one of their social accounts. EzLogin Lite supports Facebook Login only. The EzLogin Lite license is valid for only the specific domain it is purchased for, and is not transferable. The extension comes with an installation manual. However, if you need professional installation support, please add the “Installation Support” add-on while purchasing this extension. To purchase, just follow these steps: Enter your web store’s domain name &amp; add to your cart. Complete the product purchase by making payment online. A download link will be sent to the email address, provided by you in the billing address. If you’ve purchased the “Installation Support” add-on, please allow 1 business day for the VelanApps support team to connect with you.
